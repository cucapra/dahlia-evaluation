## Spatial Comparison

Generate graphs to demonstrate unpredictability in Spatial designs.

To generate all the graphs, run:
```
make all
```

### Directory structure

- `data/`: Contains all the data we collected for the Spatial comparison
- `summarize.py`: Parse and summarize all the data into CSVs.
- `banking_parser.py`: Custom parser to extract banking decisions from Spatial generated reports.
- `graphs.py`: Generate all the graphs for Spatial comparision (main paper and supplementary).
